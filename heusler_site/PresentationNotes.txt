-The idea of this website is to provide access to our data in a user friendly way.
-It would be possible to just have this information in a large, 1000 row table but that wouldn't make the information as ....
	+ easily searchable
	+ also, we can know make more detailed information available (how the information was obtained)
	+ we can link to outside information and incorporate that with our data ( we're working to integrate information on stability against other compounds from OQMD)
	+ by giving each material a page, we can have band plots and density of states graphs
	---------------------------Add more benefits of a full website over just publishing a large table----------------------
-By publishing the information on our own website we have full control over what information is displayed and how it is displayed


-Home Page:
	+ contains overview of what the database offers
	+ guides the user to what they want to see next (begin searching or see technical details)
	+ in the footer we contain information to comply with the universities requirements (a link back to ua's main website, disclaimer, and a contact form)
 
-Search index
	------------height of structure in search results is off.
	------------padding doesn't work that well
	------------vertical bars don't continue down if there are no results
	+ makes it simple to look through available materials
	+ filter by elements composing the compound
	+ important material information is available in the table while searching

-Material page
	+ contains all detailed information on each material
	+ Contains density of states graph and band structure plot
	+ we've talked to oqmd about adding a stability check against their materials

------------Get consistent titles. Have icon image----------------
